Document Clustering using K-Means & TF-IDF
# Overview
This project focuses on clustering text documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using K-Means clustering and TF-IDF vectorization.

# Key Features
# Data Source: 20 Newsgroups dataset (different categories of text documents).

# Text Processing: Converts raw text into numerical form using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

# Clustering Algorithm: Uses K-Means clustering to group similar documents.

# Evaluation Metric: Measures clustering quality using Silhouette Score.

# Visualization: Uses TruncatedSVD (PCA for sparse data) to plot document clusters in 2D space.
